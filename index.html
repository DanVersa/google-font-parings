            Smokum is a western inspired slab-serif font with a little playful swagger to it. It's perfect for headlines and display uses that require a little loosened up country flair, but because of the contrast of thicks and thins, it will perform best as a WebFont at medium to large point sizes.

            Open Sans is a humanist sans serif typeface designed by Steve Matteson, Type Director of Ascender Corp. This version contains the complete 897 character set, which includes the standard ISO Latin 1, Latin CE, Greek and Cyrillic character sets. Open Sans was designed with an upright stress, open forms and a neutral, yet friendly appearance. It was optimized for print, web, and mobile interfaces, and has excellent legibility characteristics in its letterforms.

            League Gothic is a revival of an old classic: Alternate Gothic. It was originally designed by Morris Fuller Bentonfor the American Type Founders Company in 1903. The League Of Moveable Type decided to make their own version, and contribute it to the Open Source Type Movement. Thanks to a commission from the fine & patient folks over at WND.com, it’s been revised and updated with contributions from Micah Rich, Tyler Finck, Dannci and Mirko Velimirovic.
